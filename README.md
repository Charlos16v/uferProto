# UferProto project
Little web app using OLOO for the business domain logic, and encapsulating that in expressJS using a nodeJS server, also a little CLI UI version for demostrate the clean architecture.

## Clean Architecture
> “Your architectures should tell readers about the system, not about the frameworks you used in your system” — Robert C. Martin

Resilient software is divided into layers, underpinned by business logic and is independent of technologies. 

It should be:

1. **Independent of Frameworks**. Libraries and frameworks should be treated as tools and not dependencies.
2. **Testable**. Can be tested without external dependencies.
3. **Independent of UI**. You can easily switch CLI UI, Web...etc.
4. **Independent of Database**. Switch out SQL for MongoDB or in memory database.
5. **Independent of any external agency**. Business rules don't know anything about outside world.


In practice, choice of technology should be the last decision you make or code you write (e.g. database, platform, framework).

By following clean architecture, you can write software today that can be easily switched out for different technologies in the future.
